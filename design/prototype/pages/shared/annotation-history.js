/* Shared annotation-history event model (spec 015 v5.0.0, issues #578/#596).
 *
 * The prototype grew three unconnected history mechanisms -- the workspace
 * 歷程 panel (spec 015 FR-016B), task-detail's per-annotator review timeline
 * (spec 014 FR-015d-4) and its dry-run round history -- each with its own
 * notion of what an event is. This module is the single place the shared
 * parts live, following the same window.LabelSuite* pattern as sidebar.js
 * and modal-focus.js, so a second consumer never has to restate them.
 *
 * Scope is the RENDER side only. Event construction, result_snapshot and
 * FR-090 masking belong to annotation-workspace.data.js: that module writes
 * history at load time (seedReviewFlowDemo) on all six pages that include
 * it, so a dependency in this direction would have to be wired into every
 * one of them, while it is already the data layer they all share.
 *
 * FR-086: `action` is a closed set. Every value owns exactly one badge
 * modifier class, and that mapping is data, not a render-site branch -- the
 * three-way ternary it replaces silently rendered `skipped` as `submitted`.
 * A value outside the set (an event written by an older build) keeps the
 * neutral base badge rather than borrowing another action's meaning.

     stopped writing a reviewer wrapper event (issue #583 / FR-086 R1), a
     reviewer submit wrote an envelope `submitted` event and then one
     decision event per approved outKey. The envelope deliberately carried
     no answer -- the data layer omitted its snapshot because the decision
     events already held it -- so beside them it read as a bare duplicate,
     and #596 added two more reviewer actions to the same trail.

     Folded away here rather than at the write site: the events already in
     localStorage would otherwise keep their duplicate card until someone
     cleared their browser, and the envelope still carries FR-088 timing and
     the audit fact that a submit happened. New reviewer submits no longer
     produce this envelope, so this filter has nothing to fold for them; it
     still folds any pre-#583 envelope already sitting in a user's
     localStorage (events are append-only and never rewritten).

     Dropped only when that same reviewer's next act was a decision. A
     reviewer who recorded no decision at all emits none, leaving the
     envelope as their only trace in the reviewer bucket. The annotator's
     `submitted` is never dropped -- it is the one event carrying their
     answer.

     `bypassed` counts as a decision (issue #596): appendReviewDecisionEvents()
     (annotation-workspace.data.js) writes it per outKey exactly like the
     other two via its REVIEW_DECISION_EVENT_ACTION table (issue #804), so
     leaving it out would resurrect the duplicate envelope for every
     reviewer who could not decide. The other new values do not --

     than answer one of its outputs, and none is written behind a submit

     A plain sum is wrong because lead_time is not per-event: it is the
     running page-visible accumulator for one OPEN SESSION, stamped with the
     started_at of that opening. Pre-issue #583 data copied it verbatim onto
     every event a single reviewer submit wrote -- the envelope plus one
     decision per outKey -- so summing the column multiplied a reviewer's
     time by their output count for that legacy shape. Since issue #583
     (FR-088 R2), a submit carries it on only its first-written event, but
     grouping is still needed: a session that first saves a draft and later
     submits still shares one started_at across those two events.

     So group by session and sum the groups. The session is (actorId,
     started_at): started_at alone would merge two people who happened to
     open the sample at the same instant, and actorId alone would merge the
     two openings of one reviewer who came back to the sample later -- which
     is real additional work and must still add up.

     Within a group take the largest value, not the first or the last. The
     accumulator only grows while the session is open, so the largest is the
     session's final duration regardless of what order the events merged in.
     This is deliberately NOT a global maximum: that would collapse the two
     sessions the grouping just kept apart.

     Events with no started_at each count on their own. They predate FR-088
