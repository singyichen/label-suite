/* Shared annotation-history event model (spec 015 v5.0.0, issues #578/#596).
 *
 * The prototype grew three unconnected history mechanisms -- the workspace
 * 歷程 panel (spec 015 FR-016B), task-detail's per-annotator review timeline
 * (spec 014 FR-015d-4) and its dry-run round history -- each with its own
 * notion of what an event is. This module is the single place the shared
 * parts live, following the same window.LabelSuite* pattern as sidebar.js
 * and modal-focus.js, so a second consumer never has to restate them.
 *
 * Scope is the RENDER side only. Event construction, result_snapshot and
 * FR-090 masking belong to annotation-workspace.data.js: that module writes
 * history at load time (seedReviewFlowDemo) on all six pages that include
 * it, so a dependency in this direction would have to be wired into every
 * one of them, while it is already the data layer they all share.
 *
 * FR-086: `action` is a closed set. Every value owns exactly one badge
 * modifier class, and that mapping is data, not a render-site branch -- the
 * three-way ternary it replaces silently rendered `skipped` as `submitted`.
 * A value outside the set (an event written by an older build) keeps the
 * neutral base badge rather than borrowing another action's meaning.

     per approved outKey. The envelope deliberately carries no answer -- the
     data layer omits its snapshot because the decision events already hold
     it -- so beside them it reads as a bare duplicate, and #596 adds two
     more reviewer actions to the same trail.

     Folded away here rather than at the write site: the events already in
     localStorage would otherwise keep their duplicate card until someone
     cleared their browser, and the envelope still carries FR-088 timing and
     the audit fact that a submit happened.

     Dropped only when that same reviewer's next act was a decision. A
     reviewer who recorded no decision at all emits none, leaving the
     envelope as their only trace in the reviewer bucket. The annotator's
     `submitted` is never dropped -- it is the one event carrying their
     answer.

     `bypassed` counts as a decision (issue #596): it is written per outKey
     exactly like the other two, so leaving it out would resurrect the
     duplicate envelope for every reviewer who could not decide. The other
     new values do not -- `adjudicated`, `exception_resolved` and `excluded`
     close a unit rather than answer one of its outputs, and none is written
