# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for the Label Suite project.

## What is an ADR?

An ADR captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. Each record is immutable once accepted — if a decision changes, a new ADR supersedes the old one.

## Format

Each ADR follows this structure:

- **Status**: Accepted / Proposed / Deprecated / Superseded
- **Context**: The forces at play, including technical, research, and project constraints.
- **Decision**: The change we are making.
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or harder as a result (and alternatives rejected).
