Read the `readme.md` file within this skill, and explore the other available files.

If creating visual artifacts (slides, mocks, throwaway prototypes, etc), copy assets out
and create static HTML files for the user to view. If working on production code, you can
copy assets and read the rules here to become an expert in designing with this brand.

If the user invokes this skill without any other guidance, ask them what they want to
build or design, ask some questions, and act as an expert designer who outputs HTML
artifacts _or_ production code, depending on the need.
